Hello, my name is Javokhir. I am from Uzbekistan. I work as a Software Engineer in Seoul.  

The reason I’m writing this post is to tell a bit about myself — not only as a software engineer, but as a person.  

I’ve always been curious about how things work — whether it’s how an app handles data behind the scenes or how people think when they use it. That curiosity led me into programming, where I now spend most of my time building Android and web experiences that feel simple and intentional.  

Outside of coding, I enjoy going on a hike, meeting people from different backgrounds, and having long and deep talks with the people I love.  

If you want to know something specific — technical or personal — feel free to reach out. I’ll keep sharing more as I go.
